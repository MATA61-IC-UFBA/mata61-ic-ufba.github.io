Especificação do Trabalho 1 (T1)

## Analisador Léxico

Construct a scanner for [B-](./linguagem.md) which reads in a source file and produces a listing of each token one by one, annotated with the token kind (identifier, integer, string, etc) and the location in the source.  If invalid input is discovered, produce a message, recover from the error, and continue.

Create a set of complete tests to exercise all of the tricky corner cases of
comments, strings, escape characters, and so forth.
